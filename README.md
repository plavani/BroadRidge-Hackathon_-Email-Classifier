# Email Classifier
<a href="#">https://broadridgehackathonemailclassifier.streamlit.app</a><br>

This is our submission for the Broadridge Hackathon, for the topic "E-Mail Classifier", from the Team Mean Coders. <br>
The problem is to build an email categorization system that accurately classifies incoming emails based on language, spam, tone, action, and urgency. <br>
The solution should adapt to new kinds of emails, and learn from user feedback and adjust the categorization accordingly.<br>
The goal is to create an efficient and effective system for automatically organizing and prioritizing emails, which can help users to save time and reduce the risk of missing important messages.<br>


My solution to the Email Categorization problem is a comprehensive system that detects the language, spam, tone, action, and urgency of incoming emails.<br> 
We collected a labeled dataset of emails and preprocessed the data to extract relevant features such as the subject line, email body, sender, recipient, date, and time.<br>
We used NLP techniques and ML algorithms for language detection, spam detection, tone identification, action categorization, and urgency prioritization and evaluated the performance of our system using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and fine-tuned our algorithms to improve performance.<br>

Finally, we deployed our solution using the Streamlit app, which is an open-source Python library used for building interactive and customizable web applications for data analysis and machine learning. It simplifies the process of creating web-based data applications by providing an intuitive and straightforward interface.<br>
By including these features in our approach, our aim to improve the efficiency and productivity of email management for individuals and organizations has been achieved. <br>
This solution is scalable and customizable, and we believe it has the potential to significantly enhance email management and streamline the communication process.<br>
